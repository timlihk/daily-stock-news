## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

- **EMAIL_USER**: Your Gmail address (for sending emails)
- **EMAIL_PASS**: Your Gmail app password ([Create one here](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords))
- **EMAIL_TO**: Recipient email address
- **NEWS_API_KEY**: Get a free API key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org)
- **STOCK_SYMBOLS**: Comma-separated list of stock symbols (initial values)
- **CRON_SCHEDULE**: When to send daily emails (default: `0 8 * * *` = 8 AM daily)

### 3. Redis Setup (Required for Railway/Production)

For persistent stock symbol storage on Railway:

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click **"New"** â†’ **"Database"** â†’ **"Add Redis"**
3. Railway will automatically create a `REDIS_URL` environment variable
4. Add the variable reference to your app service:
   - Click on your app service â†’ **Variables** tab
   - Click **"New Variable"** â†’ **"Add a Reference"**
   - Select your Redis service â†’ Select `REDIS_URL`
   - Click **"Add"**

**Important**: Without Redis, stock symbol changes made through the web interface will be lost when Railway redeploys. The app will fall back to using the `.env` file (non-persistent on Railway).

### 4. Gmail Setup

To use Gmail for sending emails:

1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an app-specific password:
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" and generate a password
   - Use this password as `EMAIL_PASS` in your `.env` file

### 5. Run the Application

#### Test Mode (Send one email immediately):
```bash
npm start -- --test
```

#### Production Mode (Run with web interface and scheduled emails):
```bash
npm start
```

The web interface will be available at http://localhost:3000
