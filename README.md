The web interface will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Web Interface

Access the web interface at http://localhost:3000 to:
- Add/remove stock symbols from your watchlist
- View current stock prices
- Check configuration status
- See which stocks are being tracked

## Customization

### Stock Symbols
You can manage stocks through:
1. **Web Interface**: Visit http://localhost:3000
2. **Environment File**: Edit `STOCK_SYMBOLS` in your `.env` file:
```
STOCK_SYMBOLS=AAPL,GOOGL,MSFT,TSLA,AMZN,META,NVDA
```

### Email Schedule
The schedule uses cron format. Common examples:

- `0 9 * * 1-5` - Weekdays at 9 AM
- `0 7,18 * * *` - Twice daily at 7 AM and 6 PM

## Running as a Service

### Using PM2 (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start src/index.js --name stock-emailer
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

### Using systemd (Linux)
Create a service file at `/etc/systemd/system/stock-emailer.service`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Stock Daily Email Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your-username
WorkingDirectory=/home/timlihk/daily_email
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /home/timlihk/daily_email/src/index.js
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then enable and start:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable stock-emailer
sudo systemctl start stock-emailer
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Email not sending**: Check your Gmail app password and ensure 2FA is enabled
- **No news found**: Verify your NewsAPI key is valid and has remaining quota
- **Stock data errors**: Some international stocks may not be available through Yahoo Finance
